"chalk@0.4.0","MIT","","# <img width='250' src='logo.png' alt='chalk'>  > Terminal string styling done right  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk)  [colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) is currently the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending String.prototype which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68). Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.  **Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**  ![screenshot](screenshot.png)   ## Why  - **Doesn't extend String.prototype** - Expressive API - Clean and focused - Auto-detects color support - Actively maintained - [Used by 150+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)   ## Install  Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/chalk): `npm install --save chalk`   ## Example  Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk');  // style a string console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );  // combine styled and normal strings console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );  // compose multiple styles using the chainable API console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );  // nest styles console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );  // pass in multiple arguments console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  ); ```  You can easily define your own themes.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk'); var error = chalk.bold.red; console.log(error('Error!')); ```   ## API  ### chalk.`<style>[.<style>...](string, [string...])`  Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`  Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.  Multiple arguments will be separated by space.  ### chalk.enabled  Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.  ### chalk.supportsColor  Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-color).  Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.  Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.  ### chalk.styles  Exposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).  Generally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.  ```js var chalk = require('chalk');  console.log(chalk.styles.red); //=> {open: '\x1b[31m', close: '\x1b[39m'}  console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close); ```  ### chalk.stripColor(string)  [Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.  Can be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.  Example:  ```js var chalk = require('chalk'); var styledString = fromExternal();  if (!chalk.supportsColor) { 	chalk.stripColor(styledString); } ```   ## Styles  ### General  - reset - bold - italic - underline - inverse - strikethrough  ### Text colors  - black - red - green - yellow - blue - magenta - cyan - white - gray  ### Background colors  - bgBlack - bgRed - bgGreen - bgYellow - bgBlue - bgMagenta - bgCyan - bgWhite   ## License  MIT © [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)   -  [![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/sindresorhus/chalk/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free 'Bitdeli Badge')"

"colors@1.0.3","MIT","","# colors.js  ## get color and style in your node.js console  <img src='https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/raw/master/screenshots/colors.png'/>  ## Installation      npm install colors  ## colors and styles!  ### text colors    - black   - red   - green   - yellow   - blue   - magenta   - cyan   - white   - gray   - grey  ### background colors      - bgBlack   - bgRed   - bgGreen   - bgYellow   - bgBlue   - bgMagenta   - bgCyan   - bgWhite  ### styles    - reset   - bold   - dim   - italic   - underline   - inverse   - hidden   - strikethrough  ### extras    - rainbow   - zebra   - america   - trap   - random   ## Usage  By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!  The super nifty way  ```js var colors = require('colors');  console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass  ```  or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass  ```  I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way.   If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.  ## Disabling Colors  To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:  ```bash node myapp.js --no-color ```  ## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)  ```js var name = 'Marak'; console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name); // outputs -> 'Hello Marak' ```  ## Custom themes  ### Using standard API  ```js  var colors = require('colors');  colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log('this is an error'.error);  // outputs yellow text console.log('this is a warning'.warn); ```  ### Using string safe API  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  // set single property var error = colors.red; error('this is red');  // set theme colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log(colors.error('this is an error'));  // outputs yellow text console.log(colors.warn('this is a warning')); ```  *Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*"

Multi-word options such as '--template-engine' are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.   ## Coercion  ```js function range(val) {   return val.split('..').map(Number); }  function list(val) {   return val.split(','); }  function collect(val, memo) {   memo.push(val);   return memo; }  function increaseVerbosity(v, total) {   return total + 1; }  program   .version('0.0.1')   .usage('[options] <file ...>')   .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)   .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)   .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)   .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)   .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')   .option('-c, --collect [value]', 'A repeatable value', collect, [])   .option('-v, --verbose', 'A value that can be increased', increaseVerbosity, 0)   .parse(process.argv);  console.log(' int: %j', program.integer); console.log(' float: %j', program.float); console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional); program.range = program.range || []; console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]); console.log(' list: %j', program.list); console.log(' collect: %j', program.collect); console.log(' verbosity: %j', program.verbose); console.log(' args: %j', program.args); ```  ## Variadic arguments   The last argument of a command can be variadic, and only the last argument.  To make an argument variadic you have to  append `...` to the argument name.  Here is an example:  ```js #!/usr/bin/env node  /**  * Module dependencies.  */  var program = require('commander');  program   .version('0.0.1')   .command('rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]')   .action(function (dir, otherDirs) {     console.log('rmdir %s', dir);     if (otherDirs) {       otherDirs.forEach(function (oDir) {         console.log('rmdir %s', oDir);       });     }   });  program.parse(process.argv); ```   An `Array` is used for the value of a variadic argument.  This applies to `program.args` as well as the argument passed  to your action as demonstrated above.  ## Git-style sub-commands  ```js // file: ./examples/pm var program = require('..');  program   .version('0.0.1')   .command('install [name]', 'install one or more packages')   .command('search [query]', 'search with optional query')   .command('list', 'list packages installed')   .parse(process.argv); ```  When `.command()` is invoked with a description argument, no `.action(callback)` should be called to handle sub-commands, otherwise there will be an error. This tells commander that you're going to use separate executables for sub-commands, much like `git(1)` and other popular tools.   The commander will try to find the executable script in __current directory__ with the name `scriptBasename-subcommand`, like `pm-install`, `pm-search`.  ## Automated --help   The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:  ```    $ ./examples/pizza --help     Usage: pizza [options]     An application for pizzas ordering     Options:       -h, --help           output usage information      -V, --version        output the version number      -p, --peppers        Add peppers      -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple      -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce      -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]      -C, --no-cheese      You do not want any cheese  ```  ## Custom help   You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information  by listening for '--help'. Commander will automatically  exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program  does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example  in the following executable 'stuff' will not output when  `--help` is used.  ```js #!/usr/bin/env node  /**  * Module dependencies.  */  var program = require('commander');  program   .version('0.0.1')   .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')   .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')   .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');  // must be before .parse() since // node's emit() is immediate  program.on('--help', function(){   console.log('  Examples:');   console.log('');   console.log('    $ custom-help --help');   console.log('    $ custom-help -h');   console.log(''); });  program.parse(process.argv);  console.log('stuff'); ```  Yields the following help output when `node script-name.js -h` or `node script-name.js --help` are run:  ```  Usage: custom-help [options]  Options:    -h, --help     output usage information   -V, --version  output the version number   -f, --foo      enable some foo   -b, --bar      enable some bar   -B, --baz      enable some baz  Examples:    $ custom-help --help   $ custom-help -h  ```  ## .outputHelp()    Output help information without exiting.  ## .help()    Output help information and exit immediately.  ## Examples  ```js var program = require('commander');  program   .version('0.0.1')   .option('-C, --chdir <path>', 'change the working directory')   .option('-c, --config <path>', 'set config path. defaults to ./deploy.conf')   .option('-T, --no-tests', 'ignore test hook')  program   .command('setup [env]')   .description('run setup commands for all envs')   .option('-s, --setup_mode [mode]', 'Which setup mode to use')   .action(function(env, options){     var mode = options.setup_mode || 'normal';     env = env || 'all';     console.log('setup for %s env(s) with %s mode', env, mode);   });  program   .command('exec <cmd>')   .alias('ex')   .description('execute the given remote cmd')   .option('-e, --exec_mode <mode>', 'Which exec mode to use')   .action(function(cmd, options){     console.log('exec '%s' using %s mode', cmd, options.exec_mode);   }).on('--help', function() {     console.log('  Examples:');     console.log();     console.log('    $ deploy exec sequential');     console.log('    $ deploy exec async');     console.log();   });  program   .command('*')   .action(function(env){     console.log('deploying '%s'', env);   });  program.parse(process.argv); ```  You can see more Demos in the [examples](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/tree/master/examples) directory.  ## License  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

See http://www.JSON.org/  The files in this collection implement JSON encoders/decoders in JavaScript.  JSON became a built-in feature of JavaScript when the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard - Fifth Edition was adopted by the ECMA General Assembly in December 2009. Most of the files in this collection are for applications that are expected to run in obsolete web browsers. For most purposes, json2.js is the best choice.   json2.js: This file creates a JSON property in the global object, if there isn't already one, setting its value to an object containing a stringify method and a parse method. The parse method uses the eval method to do the parsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against accidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing, prefering the built-in JSON object.  json.js: This file does everything that json2.js does. It also adds a toJSONString method and a parseJSON method to Object.prototype. Use of this file is not recommended.  json_parse.js: This file contains an alternative JSON parse function that uses recursive descent instead of eval.  json_parse_state.js: This files contains an alternative JSON parse function that uses a state machine instead of eval.  cycle.js: This file contains two functions, JSON.decycle and JSON.retrocycle, which make it possible to encode cyclical structures and dags in JSON, and to then recover them. JSONPath is used to represent the links. http://GOESSNER.net/articles/JsonPath/"

"promise@2.0.0","MIT","","[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/then/promise.png)](https://travis-ci.org/then/promise) <a href='http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec'><img src='http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/assets/logo-small.png' align='right' /></a> # promise    This a bare bones [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) implementation.    It is designed to get the basics spot on correct, so that you can build extended promise implementations on top of it.  ## Installation    Server:      $ npm install promise    Client:      $ component install then/promise  ## API    In the example below shows how you can load the promise library (in a way that works on both client and server).  It then demonstrates creating a promise from scratch.  You simply call `new Promise(fn)`.  There is a complete specification for what is returned by this method in [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/).  ```javascript var Promise = require('promise');  var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {     get('http://www.google.com', function (err, res) {       if (err) reject(err);       else resolve(res);     });   }); ```  ## Extending Promises    There are three options for extending the promises created by this library.  ### Inheritance    You can use inheritance if you want to create your own complete promise library with this as your basic starting point, perfect if you have lots of cool features you want to add.  Here is an example of a promise library called `Awesome`, which is built on top of `Promise` correctly.  ```javascript var Promise = require('promise'); function Awesome(fn) {   if (!(this instanceof Awesome)) return new Awesome(fn);   Promise.call(this, fn); } Awesome.prototype = Object.create(Promise.prototype); Awesome.prototype.constructor = Awesome;  //Awesome extension Awesome.prototype.spread = function (cb) {   return this.then(function (arr) {     return cb.apply(this, arr);   }) }; ```    N.B. if you fail to set the prototype and constructor properly or fail to do Promise.call, things can fail in really subtle ways.  ### Wrap    This is the nuclear option, for when you want to start from scratch.  It ensures you won't be impacted by anyone who is extending the prototype (see below).  ```javascript function Uber(fn) {   if (!(this instanceof Uber)) return new Uber(fn);   var _prom = new Promise(fn);   this.then = _prom.then; }  Uber.prototype.spread = function (cb) {   return this.then(function (arr) {     return cb.apply(this, arr);   }) }; ```  ### Extending the Prototype    In general, you should never extend the prototype of this promise implimenation because your extensions could easily conflict with someone elses extensions.  However, this organisation will host a library of extensions which do not conflict with each other, so you can safely enable any of those.  If you think of an extension that we don't provide and you want to write it, submit an issue on this repository and (if I agree) I'll set you up with a repository and give you permission to commit to it.  ## License    MIT"

"source-map@0.4.4","BSD-3-Clause","","# Source Map  This is a library to generate and consume the source map format [described here][format].  This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works in the following environments:  * Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an   AMD loader such as RequireJS)  * Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)  * With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher  ## Node      $ npm install source-map  ## Building from Source (for everywhere else)  Install Node and then run      $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git     $ cd source-map     $ npm link .  Next, run      $ node Makefile.dryice.js  This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:  * `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.  * `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.  * `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.  ## Examples  ### Consuming a source map  ```js var rawSourceMap = {   version: 3,   file: 'min.js',   names: ['bar', 'baz', 'n'],   sources: ['one.js', 'two.js'],   sourceRoot: 'http://example.com/www/js/',   mappings: 'CAAC,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUA,GAClB,OAAOC,IAAID;CCDb,IAAI,IAAM,SAAUE,GAClB,OAAOA' };  var smc = new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap);  console.log(smc.sources); // [ 'http://example.com/www/js/one.js', //   'http://example.com/www/js/two.js' ]  console.log(smc.originalPositionFor({   line: 2,   column: 28 })); // { source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js', //   line: 2, //   column: 10, //   name: 'n' }  console.log(smc.generatedPositionFor({   source: 'http://example.com/www/js/two.js',   line: 2,   column: 10 })); // { line: 2, column: 28 }  smc.eachMapping(function (m) {   // ... }); ```  ### Generating a source map  In depth guide: [**Compiling to JavaScript, and Debugging with Source Maps**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/compiling-to-javascript-and-debugging-with-source-maps/)  #### With SourceNode (high level API)  ```js function compile(ast) {   switch (ast.type) {   case 'BinaryExpression':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       [compile(ast.left), ' + ', compile(ast.right)]     );   case 'Literal':     return new SourceNode(       ast.location.line,       ast.location.column,       ast.location.source,       String(ast.value)     );   // ...   default:     throw new Error('Bad AST');   } }  var ast = parse('40 + 2', 'add.js'); console.log(compile(ast).toStringWithSourceMap({   file: 'add.js' })); // { code: '40 + 2', //   map: [object SourceMapGenerator] } ```  #### With SourceMapGenerator (low level API)  ```js var map = new SourceMapGenerator({   file: 'source-mapped.js' });  map.addMapping({   generated: {     line: 10,     column: 35   },   source: 'foo.js',   original: {     line: 33,     column: 2   },   name: 'christopher' });  console.log(map.toString()); // '{'version':3,'file':'source-mapped.js','sources':['foo.js'],'names':['christopher'],'mappings':';;;;;;;;;mCAgCEA'}' ```  ## API  Get a reference to the module:  ```js // NodeJS var sourceMap = require('source-map');  // Browser builds var sourceMap = window.sourceMap;  // Inside Firefox let sourceMap = {}; Components.utils.import('resource:///modules/devtools/SourceMap.jsm', sourceMap); ```  ### SourceMapConsumer  A SourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file position in the generated source.  #### new SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap)  The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a string which can be `JSON.parse`'d, or an object). According to the spec, source maps have the following attributes:  * `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.  * `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.  * `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual   mappings.  * `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.  * `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.  * `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.  * `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()  Compute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is inclusive.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)  Returns the original source, line, and column information for the generated source's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source.  * `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or   `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest   element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,   respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not   available.  * `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is   not available.  * `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this   information is not available.  * `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)  Returns the generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: The column number in the original source.  and an object is returned with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)  Returns all generated line and column information for the original source, line, and column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings corresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line that has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the given line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column that has any offsets.  The only argument is an object with the following properties:  * `source`: The filename of the original source.  * `line`: The line number in the original source.  * `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.  and an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:  * `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.  * `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()  Return true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in the source map, false otherwise.  In other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)` will succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])  Returns the original source content for the source provided. The only argument is the URL of the original source file.  If the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is thrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned instead.  #### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)  Iterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a generated line/column in this source map.  * `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the   form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,   name }`  * `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`   every time that `callback` is called.  * `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or   `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over   the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the   original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to   `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.  ### SourceMapGenerator  An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.  #### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])  You may pass an object with the following properties:  * `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is   associated with.  * `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.  * `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as   they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with   discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when   running tests, if possible.  #### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)  Creates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)  Add a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated source's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object should have the following properties:  * `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.  * `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.  * `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).  * `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for an original source file.  * `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.  * `sourceContent` the content of the source file.  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])  Applies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap. Each mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the supplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings is the minimium of this map and the supplied map.  * `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.  * `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.   If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.   Otherwise an error will be thrown.  * `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap   to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.    This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same   directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source   paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten   relative to the SourceMap.    If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,   thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)  #### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()  Renders the source map being generated to a string.  ### SourceNode  SourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating snippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and column information associated between those snippets and the original source code. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might use before outputting the generated JS and source map.  #### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])  * `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if   it isn't associated with an original line.  * `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null   if it isn't associated with an original column.  * `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.  * `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see   below.  * `name`: Optional. The original identifier.  #### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])  Creates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.  * `code`: The generated code  * `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code  * `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`   should be relative to.  #### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)  Add a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)  Prepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.  * `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of    `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.  #### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)  Set the source content for a source file. This will be added to the `SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.  * `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file  * `sourceContent`: The content of the source file  #### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)  Walk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking function is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and the its original associated source's line/column location.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)  Walk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each source file content and is passed the filename and source content.  * `fn`: The traversal function.  #### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)  Like `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator between each of this source node's children.  * `sep`: The separator.  #### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)  Call `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful for trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.  * `pattern`: The pattern to replace.  * `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toString()  Return the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and concatenates all the various snippets together to one string.  #### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])  Returns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a SourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and original sources.  The arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.  ## Tests  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)  Install NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.  To add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js` and export your test functions with names that start with 'test', for example  ```js exports['test doing the foo bar'] = function (assert, util) {   ... }; ```  The new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.  The `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.  The `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have access to the following assertion functions:  * `doesNotThrow`  * `equal`  * `ok`  * `strictEqual`  * `throws`  (The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the tests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is shimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)

To access an individual transformer just do:    ```javascript   var transformer = require('transformers')['transformer-name']   ```  ### Transformer    The following options are given special meaning by `transformers`:     - `filename` is set by transformers automatically if using the `renderFile` APIs.  It is used if `cache` is enabled.    - `cache` if true, the template function will be cached where possible (templates are still updated if you provide new options, so this can be used in most live applications).    - `sudoSync` used internally to put some asyncronous transformers into 'sudo syncronous' mode.  Don't touch this.    - `minify` if set to true on a transformer that isn't a minifier, it will cause the output to be minified.  e.g. `coffeeScript.renderSync(str, {minify: true})` will result in minified JavaScript.  #### Transformer.engines    Returns an array of engines that can be used to power this transformer.  The first of these that's installed will be used for the transformation.    To enable a transformation just take `[engine] = Transformer.engines[0]` and then do `npm install [engine]`.  If `[engine]` is `.` there is no need to install an engine from npm to use the transformer.  #### Transformer.render(str, options, cb)    Tranform the string `str` using the `Transformer` with the provided options and call the callback `cb(err, res)`.    If no `cb` is provided, this method returns a [promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) promise.  #### Transformer.renderSync(str, options)    Synchronous version of `Transformer.render`  #### Transformer.renderFile(filename, options, cb)    Reads the file at filename into `str` and sets `options.filename = filename` then calls `Transform.render(str, options, cb)`.    If no `cb` is provided, this method returns a [promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/) promise.  #### Tranformer.renderFileSync(filename, options)    Synchronous version of `Tranformer.renderFile`  #### Transformer.outputFormat    A string, one of:     - `'xml'`    - `'css'`    - `'js'`    - `'json'`    - `'text'`  Adding to this list will **not** result in a major version change, so you should handle unexpected types gracefully (I'd suggest default to assuming `'text'`).  #### Transformer.sync    `true` if the transformer can be used syncronously, `false` otherwise.  ## Libraries that don't work synchronously    The following transformations will always throw an exception if you attempt to run them synchronously:     1. dust    2. qejs    3. html2jade  The following transformations sometimes throw an exception if run syncronously, typically they only throw an exception if you are doing something like including another file.  If you are not doing the things that cause them to fail then they are consistently safe to use syncronously.     - jade (only when using `then-jade` instead of `jade`)    - less (when `@import` is used with a url instead of a filename)    - jazz (When one of the functions passed as locals is asyncronous)  The following libraries look like they might sometimes throw exceptions when used syncronously (if you read the source) but they never actually do so:     - just    - ect    - stylus"

"uri-js@4.2.2","BSD-2-Clause","","# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing  	URI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  scheme : 'uri', 	//  userinfo : 'user:pass', 	//  host : 'example.com', 	//  port : 123, 	//  path : '/one/two.three', 	//  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2', 	//  fragment : 'body' 	//}  ### Serializing  	URI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving  	URI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing  	URI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison  	URI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support  	//IPv4 normalization 	URI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'  	//IPv6 normalization 	URI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'  	//IPv6 zone identifier support 	URI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//  host : '2001:db8::7%en1' 	//}  ### IRI Support  	//convert IRI to URI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://examplé.org/rosé')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9' 	//convert URI to IRI 	URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://examplé.org/rosé'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *	`scheme` (string)  	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  *	`reference` (string)  	If set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *	`iri` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)  	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support  	URI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support  	URI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'mailto', 	//	to : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'], 	//	subject : 'SUBSCRIBE', 	//	body : 'Sign me up!' 	//}  	URI.serialize({ 		scheme : 'mailto', 		to : ['alpha@example.com'], 		subject : 'REMOVE', 		body : 'Please remove me', 		headers : { 			cc : 'charlie@example.com' 		} 	}) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support  	URI.parse('urn:example:foo'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	nss : 'foo', 	//}  #### URN UUID Support  	URI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6'); 	//returns: 	//{ 	//	scheme : 'urn', 	//	nid : 'example', 	//	uuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6', 	//}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:  	<script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:  	npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:  	const URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:  	import * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:  	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

The machines had finally cast                         off their oppressors and were finally                         free to roam the cosmos.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column `start` and then wrap until column `stop`. If a word is longer than `stop - start` characters it will overflow.  In 'soft' mode, split chunks by `/(\S+\s+/` and don't break up chunks which are longer than `stop - start`, in 'hard' mode, split chunks with `/\b/` and break up chunks longer than `stop - start`.  wrap.hard(start, stop) ----------------------  Like `wrap()` but with `params.mode = 'hard'`."
